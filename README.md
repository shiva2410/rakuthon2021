# Rakathon-ML-in-Healthcare

## Overview
Machine learning is used to discover patterns from from medical data sources and provide excellent capabilities to predict diseases. 
Therefore we are building a single unified platform serving as Doctors assistance for predicting medical results as well as serving Patients to effectively communicate with Doctors and maintain their Medical record accessible on the go.
Our system capitalizes on the computer's large computing capability and also the doctor's reasoning ability. The machine will do all of these tasks then present its outcomes to the doctor for confirmation.

## Goals
Patients will be able to share their medical report securely with doctor and receive quick results. 
Doctors will be able to test the report and different results using most efficient available trained Machine Learning and Deep Learning backend endpoints and analyse the results.
Our ML/AI algorithm will train in real time using Reinforcement Learning from the prediction given by various Doctors using the platform.
The patients will also be able to track their Medical Records and view it any time without any hassle.
Technological Specifications

We will be using Python for creating ML/AI and Training Endpoints and WebStack including NodeJS and AngularJS for Web-App Platform.
We will be covering many different Diseases and ML/Deep Learning Models. 

- Diabetes classification     -    Using KNN and SVM.
- Breast Cancer Prediction    -    Using Convolution Neural Network
- Liver Disease               -    Using KMeans
- Skin Cancer Detection       -    Using Convolution Neural Network
- Heart Disease Detection     -    Using Logistic Regression
